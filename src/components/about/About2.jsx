            <p className='text'>Hi, I'm Girish Giri a 14 years old student in 10th class and also a certified web developer. I started coding when I was very young, and since then I've built more than 45 personal projects. Most of them are private, but  each one is made with care to be pixel perfect and responsive on every screen.</p>
            <p className='text'>My elder brother has always been my guide he showed me what's right, what's wrong, and motivated me to keep improving. Because of that support, I've grown more confident and fearless in trying new things.</p>
            <p className='text'>I love exploring new frameworks, experimenting with designs, and solving problems in creative ways. Hackathons and coding competitions make me excited because they help me learn faster and connected with other developers.</p>
            <p className='text'>For me, coding is not just about writing lines of code it's about creating websites that feel alive, easy to use, and meaningful. My dream is to keep learning, contribute to open source, and one day build tools that inspire others to start their own coding journey.</p>
