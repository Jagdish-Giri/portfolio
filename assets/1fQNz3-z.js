        <h2>Step 1: Learn HTML & CSS (2-3 months)</h2>
        <p>Start with the basics. HTML is the structure of websites, CSS makes them beautiful.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Node.js and Express</li>
          <li>Databases (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)</li>
          <li>REST APIs</li>
          <li>Authentication</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 5: Version Control & Deployment</h2>
        <p>Essential skills every developer needs:</p>

        </ul>

          <li>E-commerce site</li>
          <li>Blog platform</li>
          <li>Dashboard application</li>
          <li>Real-world clone (Netflix, Twitter, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 7: Apply for Jobs</h2>

      `},"react-tutorial-for-beginners":{title:"React JS Tutorial for Beginners - Learn React in Simple Steps",date:"Feb 22, 2026",category:"React",readTime:"12 min read",image:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633356122544-f134324a6cee?w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop",content:`
        <p>React is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you're confused about where to start, this beginner-friendly tutorial will make React simple for you!</p>

        <h2>What is React?</h2>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook (Meta). It's used to build fast, interactive user interfaces. Think of apps like Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb - all built with React!</p>

        <h2>Why Learn React?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High Demand</strong>: Most companies hire React developers</li>
          <li><strong>Great Salary</strong>: React developers earn 30-40% more</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to Learn</strong>: Simpler than other frameworks</li>
          <li><strong>Huge Community</strong>: Tons of resources and help</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Before learning React, you MUST know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML & CSS basics</li>
          <li>JavaScript fundamentals</li>
          <li>ES6 features (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator)</li>
          <li>Array methods (map, filter, reduce)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setting Up React</h2>
        <p>Install Node.js first, then run:</p>
        <code>npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start</code>
        <p>Your first React app will open at localhost:3000! 🎉</p>

        <h2>Understanding Components</h2>
        <p>Everything in React is a component. Think of components as LEGO blocks - you combine them to build complex UIs.</p>
        <code>function Welcome() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}</code>

        <h2>JSX - JavaScript + HTML</h2>
        <p>JSX lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It looks weird at first but you'll love it!</p>
        <code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;</code>

        <h2>Props - Passing Data</h2>
        <p>Props are like arguments to functions. They let you pass data from parent to child components.</p>
        <code>function Greeting(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

&lt;Greeting name="Girish" /&gt;</code>

        <h2>State - Managing Data</h2>
        <p>State is data that changes over time. Use useState hook:</p>
        <code>import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Increase
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code>

        <h2>useEffect - Side Effects</h2>
        <p>useEffect runs code after render. Perfect for API calls, timers, etc.</p>
        <code>useEffect(() => {
  document.title = \`Count: \${count}\`;
}, [count]);</code>

        <h2>Handling Events</h2>
        <p>React events are similar to HTML events but use camelCase:</p>
        <code>&lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code>

        <h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>
        <p>Show different UI based on conditions:</p>
        <code>{isLoggedIn ? &lt;Dashboard /&gt; : &lt;Login /&gt;}</code>

        <h2>Lists and Keys</h2>
        <p>Render lists using map():</p>
        <code>{items.map(item => (
  &lt;li key={item.id}&gt;{item.name}&lt;/li&gt;
))}</code>

        <h2>Your First React Project</h2>
        <p>Build a todo app! It teaches:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Components</li>
          <li>State management</li>
          <li>Event handling</li>
          <li>Lists and keys</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Modifying state directly (use setState!)</li>
          <li>Forgetting keys in lists</li>
          <li>Not understanding props vs state</li>
          <li>Overusing useEffect</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>After basics, learn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>React Router (navigation)</li>
          <li>Context API (global state)</li>
          <li>Custom hooks</li>
          <li>API integration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Learning Resources</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Official React docs (react.dev)</li>
          <li>freeCodeCamp React course</li>
          <li>YouTube tutorials</li>
          <li>Build real projects!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>React is powerful but not difficult. Practice daily and you'll master it in 2-3 months. I learned React at 13 and built 50+ projects. You can do it too! 💪</p>

        <p>Don't learn multiple languages at once! Master ONE language first. I started with JavaScript at 13 and it changed my life. Pick your language and commit for 6 months minimum.</p>

        <p>The best language is the one you'll actually use! Choose based on your goals and start today. 🚀</p>

        <p>Hey everyone! Today I'll tell you how I learned React and how you can easily learn it too. At first React seemed really confusing to me, but when I learned it properly, everything became clear.</p>

        <h2>What is React?</h2>
        <p>In simple words, React is a JavaScript library. It's used for building websites, especially ones that are highly interactive like social media platforms and streaming services.</p>

        <p>When I first heard about React, I thought it would be super complicated. But honestly, if you know basic JavaScript, learning React is pretty straightforward.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites - What Should You Learn First?</h2>
        <p>This is really important. Don't jump directly into React. First, learn these things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML</strong> - You should know basic tags, structure, and forms</li>
          <li><strong>CSS</strong> - You need to know styling, understand flexbox</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - This is most important. Variables, functions, arrays, objects, loops - everything should be clear</li>
          <li><strong>ES6</strong> - Arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator - these are heavily used in React</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I made a mistake - I started React without properly learning JavaScript first. Had to struggle a lot. So please learn JavaScript properly first.</p>

        <h2>How to Start Learning React?</h2>
        <p>Okay, so if you know JavaScript, now start with React. Here are the steps:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Read Official Documentation</h3>
        <p>Go to React's official website. There are really good tutorials there. I also started from there. Don't skip the basics!</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Environment Setup</h3>
        <p>You'll need to install Node.js first. After that, run this command in your terminal:</p>
        <code>npx create-react-app my-first-app</code>
        <p>This will set up a basic React project for you. When my project ran for the first time, I was super excited! 😄</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Understand Components</h3>
        <p>Everything in React is a component. A component means a small piece of UI. Like a button component, a navbar component, a card component.</p>

        <p>I first learned functional components because they're easier. There are also class components, but nowadays mostly functional ones are used with hooks.</p>

        <h2>Important Concepts You Should Learn</h2>

        <h3>1. JSX</h3>
        <p>It looks like HTML but it's actually JavaScript. At first it feels a bit weird, but you get used to it in 2-3 days.</p>

        <h3>2. Props</h3>
        <p>Props means properties. You can send data from one component to another component through props. Like a parent giving something to a child! 😊</p>

        <h3>3. State</h3>
        <p>State means the component's data that can change. For example, if you make a counter app where numbers increase or decrease - that number will be in the state.</p>

        <h3>4. Hooks</h3>
        <p>useState, useEffect - these are all hooks. At first they seem confusing, but you understand them with practice. I watched several tutorial videos on hooks - they helped a lot!</p>

        <h2>My Tips for Learning React</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practice Daily</strong> - I made one small project every day when learning. Start with simple projects like counter app, todo list, weather app</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Just Copy-Paste</strong> - Write code with understanding. I used to copy-paste a lot at first and then I couldn't understand anything</li>
          <li><strong>Learn Debugging</strong> - Console.log is your best friend. Put console.log everywhere and see what's happening</li>
          <li><strong>Watch Video Tutorials</strong> - I personally watched many tutorial videos. They explain things clearly and visually</li>
          <li><strong>Build Projects</strong> - Just reading theory won't help. Build projects. I've built 45+ projects so far and learned something new from each one</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes I Used to Make</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Jumping to Advanced Topics Directly</strong> - I tried to learn complex concepts all at once. Got really confused. Learn one thing at a time.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Ignoring Console Errors</strong> - When red errors appeared, I used to ignore them. But those errors teach you what's going wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Not Reading Documentation</strong> - I used to search for video tutorials for everything. But official documentation is really helpful.</p>

        <h2>Resources I Use for Learning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Official React documentation</li>
          <li>Video tutorials from various online platforms</li>
          <li>Practice coding challenges on different websites</li>
          <li>Open source projects for learning from others' code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Learning React is not difficult. You just need to be consistent and practice regularly. I'm 14 years old and I learned it, so you can definitely learn it too!</p>

      `},"website-pricing-guide":{title:"How Much Does It Cost to Build a Website?",date:"Feb 18, 2026",category:"Business",readTime:"4 min read",image:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop",content:`
        <p>This is the most common question people ask me - "How much do you charge for building a website?" So today I'll talk about this topic in detail.</p>

        <h2>Different Types of Websites, Different Prices</h2>
        <p>Look, building a simple landing page and building a complex e-commerce platform - there's a huge difference. The price will be accordingly.</p>

        <h3>1. Simple Landing Page / Portfolio</h3>
        <p><strong>Price Range: ₹3,000 - ₹10,000</strong></p>
        <p>If you need a basic portfolio with your name, about section, and contact form - this is the most affordable option. I also built my portfolio in a similar way.</p>
        <p>What's included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1-3 pages</li>
          <li>Basic design</li>
          <li>Mobile responsive</li>
          <li>Contact form</li>
          <li>Ready in 1-2 weeks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Business Website</h3>
        <p><strong>Price Range: ₹10,000 - ₹30,000</strong></p>
        <p>If you have a business and want a professional website, it will have more features. Like about us page, services page, testimonials, blog section, etc.</p>

        <h3>3. E-commerce Website</h3>
        <p><strong>Price Range: ₹30,000 - ₹1,00,000+</strong></p>
        <p>This is the most complex and expensive. Product listing, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, user accounts - everything needs to be built. Takes a lot of time too.</p>

        <h2>Factors That Affect the Price</h2>

        <h3>1. Design Complexity</h3>
        <p>Simple design costs less. But if you want fancy animations, custom graphics, unique layouts then the price increases.</p>

        <h3>2. Features and Functionality</h3>
        <p>More features mean more money. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact form - Basic</li>
          <li>Blog section - Medium</li>
          <li>User login system - Advanced</li>
          <li>Payment integration - Advanced</li>
          <li>Admin dashboard - Very Advanced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Nowadays every website should be mobile responsive. If any developer says they won't make it responsive, find another developer! 😄</p>

        <h3>4. SEO Optimization</h3>
        <p>If you want your website to appear on Google, SEO is important. Proper SEO takes time and usually has a separate charge.</p>

        <h2>Average Pricing in India</h2>
        <p>I've done market research to understand current rates. Here's the average:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Beginners (just starting):</strong> ₹2,000 - ₹8,000</li>
          <li><strong>Intermediate (1-2 years experience):</strong> ₹8,000 - ₹25,000</li>
          <li><strong>Experienced (3+ years):</strong> ₹25,000 - ₹1,00,000+</li>
          <li><strong>Agencies:</strong> ₹50,000 - ₹5,00,000+</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hidden Costs People Often Forget</h2>

        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p>You need to buy a website name like yourname.com. Price is ₹500 - ₹1,500 per year.</p>

        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>You need hosting to keep the website online. Basic hosting is ₹1,500 - ₹5,000 per year. If traffic is high, it can cost ₹10,000+.</p>

        <h3>Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Website is built but it needs to be maintained too - updates, bug fixes, content changes. This usually has a separate yearly charge of ₹5,000 - ₹20,000.</p>

        <h2>How Can You Save Money?</h2>

        <h3>1. Use Ready-made Templates</h3>
        <p>If budget is tight, you can use website templates. They're very affordable and look good too.</p>

        <h3>2. Start Small</h3>
        <p>First build a basic website with only essential features. Later when you have money, you can add more features.</p>

        <h3>3. Hire Students or Beginners</h3>
        <p>Experienced developers are expensive. If budget is tight, hire students who are building their portfolio. Their rates are lower.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Rates</h2>
        <p>Let's be honest. I'm currently a student and recently started freelancing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple Portfolio: ₹5,000 - ₹8,000</li>
          <li>Business Website: ₹12,000 - ₹25,000</li>
          <li>Custom React App: ₹20,000 - ₹40,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I keep affordable rates because I want more people to be able to afford quality websites.</p>

        <h2>Important Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear Requirements:</strong> First decide what you need. Making changes in the middle increases the price</li>
          <li><strong>Written Agreement:</strong> Always discuss in writing what you'll get and for how much</li>
          <li><strong>Discuss Timeline:</strong> If you need it quickly, rush charges may apply</li>
          <li><strong>Check Portfolio:</strong> Look at the developer's previous work before hiring</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Website pricing depends on many factors. Don't just go for the cheapest option - quality matters! A good website is an investment that gives returns in the long term.</p>

        <p>If you need a website or have any questions about pricing, feel free to contact me. I'm always available to help! 😊</p>

        <p>I've noticed that many beginners don't understand responsive design well. So today I'll explain it to you in a very simple way.</p>

        <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
        <p>Imagine you built a website on mobile. It looks great. But when you open it on a laptop, everything is stretched and looks terrible. Or the opposite - perfect on laptop but everything breaks on mobile.</p>

        <p>Responsive design means your website looks good on every screen size - mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, everywhere!</p>

        <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
        <p>Look, nowadays 70-80% of people use the internet on mobile. If your website doesn't look good on mobile, people will close it immediately. I do the same! 😄</p>

        <p>Plus, Google also prefers responsive websites. It's important for SEO too.</p>

        <h2>How to Build a Responsive Website?</h2>

        <h3>1. Mobile-First Approach</h3>
        <p>I always design for mobile first, then adjust for larger screens. This is easier because scaling from mobile to large screen is easy, but the opposite is difficult.</p>

        <h3>2. Viewport Meta Tag</h3>
        <p>This is super important! Your HTML file should have this line:</p>
        <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>
        <p>I used to forget this initially and had to zoom in to see the website on mobile! 😅</p>

        <h3>3. Flexible Layouts</h3>
        <p>Don't use fixed widths like width: 500px. Instead use percentages like width: 80% or max-width: 1200px.</p>

        <h3>4. Media Queries</h3>
        <p>This is CSS's superpower! You can apply different styles for different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <code>
/* Mobile */
.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    width: 90%;
    padding: 20px;
  }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    width: 80%;
    max-width: 1200px;
  }
}
        </code>

        <h3>5. Flexbox and Grid</h3>
        <p>These are CSS features that make building responsive layouts super easy. When I learned flexbox, my life became so much easier!</p>

        <p>Flexbox example:</p>
        <code>
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 20px;
}

.item {
  flex: 1 1 300px; /* Magic! */
}
        </code>

        <h2>Common Breakpoints</h2>
        <p>These are the screen sizes where design usually changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> 320px - 480px</li>
          <li><strong>Tablet:</strong> 481px - 768px</li>
          <li><strong>Laptop:</strong> 769px - 1024px</li>
          <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> 1025px - 1200px</li>
          <li><strong>Large Desktop:</strong> 1201px+</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But I usually use just three: mobile (640px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px).</p>

        <h2>Making Images Responsive</h2>
        <p>Images are really important. If images aren't responsive, you'll keep scrolling on mobile!</p>

        <code>
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
        </code>

        <p>Just writing this much makes your images automatically adjust!</p>

        <h2>Font Sizes</h2>
        <p>Don't use fixed font sizes like 20px everywhere. Instead use rem or em. Or use different sizes in media queries.</p>

        <code>
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 32px */
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 1.5rem; /* 24px on mobile */
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>How to Test?</h2>

        <h3>1. Browser DevTools</h3>
        <p>Press F12 in Chrome or Firefox and click the mobile icon. You can select different devices. I always test here first!</p>

        <h3>2. Real Devices</h3>
        <p>Check on your own phone. Sometimes it looks different on actual device than simulator.</p>

        <h3>3. Online Tools</h3>
        <p>There are online tools that show how it will look on different screens.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes I Used to Make</h2>

        <h3>1. Making Everything Responsive</h3>
        <p>At first I wrote media queries for every little thing. But actually, if you use flexbox properly, many things become automatically responsive.</p>

        <h3>2. Testing Only on One Device</h3>
        <p>I used to test only on my phone. But different phones have different screen sizes. Test on all!</p>

        <h3>3. Building for Desktop Then Adjusting for Mobile</h3>
        <p>Mobile-first approach is way better. Trust me, I learned the hard way!</p>

        <h2>Helpful CSS Frameworks</h2>
        <p>If you want a shortcut, these frameworks already give responsive components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> - Very flexible and modern</li>
          <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> - Most popular, easy to use</li>
          <li><strong>Material UI</strong> - Great for React projects</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But I recommend first learn to build responsive from scratch, then use frameworks. Foundation should be strong!</p>

        <h2>Real Example - Navigation Menu</h2>
        <p>See how I make a navigation menu responsive:</p>

        <code>
/* Mobile: Vertical menu */
.nav {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.nav-item {
  padding: 15px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

/* Desktop: Horizontal menu */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .nav {
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
  
  .nav-item {
    border-bottom: none;
    border-right: 1px solid #ddd;
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Touch Targets:</strong> Buttons should be at least 44px x 44px on mobile. Smaller ones are hard to click</li>
          <li><strong>Hide/Show Content:</strong> Show some content on desktop, hide on mobile or vice versa. Use display: none</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Mobile might have slow internet. Optimize images, avoid heavy animations</li>
          <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Use hamburger menu for mobile. It has become standard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Responsive design initially seems tough but once you get it, it becomes second nature. Practice in every project and you'll slowly master it.</p>

        <p>My simple mantra: Mobile first, test everywhere, keep it simple!</p>

        <p>Async/Await is the modern way to handle asynchronous JavaScript. It makes your code clean, simple, and easy to read. Let's master it!</p>

        <h2>What is Asynchronous JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript runs one line at a time. But sometimes we need to wait - like fetching data from an API. That's where async code comes in!</p>

        <h2>The Problem with Callbacks</h2>
        <code>getData(function(result) {
  processData(result, function(processed) {
    saveData(processed, function(saved) {
      // Callback hell! 😱
    });
  });
});</code>

        <h2>Promises - Better but Still Messy</h2>
        <code>getData()
  .then(result => processData(result))
  .then(processed => saveData(processed))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));</code>

        <h2>Async/Await - Clean & Simple!</h2>
        <code>async function handleData() {
  try {
    const result = await getData();
    const processed = await processData(result);
    await saveData(processed);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}</code>

        <h2>How to Use Async/Await</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Add <strong>async</strong> before function</p>
        <p>Step 2: Add <strong>await</strong> before any promise</p>
        <p>Step 3: Wrap in <strong>try/catch</strong> for error handling</p>

        <h2>Fetch API with Async/Await</h2>
        <code>async function getUsers() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}</code>

        <h2>Parallel Requests</h2>
        <code>async function getAll() {
  const [users, posts] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('/api/users').then(r => r.json()),
    fetch('/api/posts').then(r => r.json())
  ]);
  return { users, posts };
}</code>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Forgetting <strong>await</strong> keyword</li>
          <li>Not using <strong>try/catch</strong></li>
          <li>Making sequential requests that could be parallel</li>
          <li>Using async/await inside forEach (use <strong>for...of</strong> instead)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Always handle errors with try/catch</li>
          <li>Use Promise.all() for parallel requests</li>
          <li>async functions always return a Promise</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Async/Await is one of the most used features in modern JavaScript. Master it and your code quality will jump significantly! 🚀</p>

        <p>One question every new developer faces: Should I learn Frontend or Backend? Let's break down both and help you decide!</p>

        <h2>What is Frontend Development?</h2>
        <p>Frontend is everything the user SEES and INTERACTS with. Buttons, layouts, animations, forms - all frontend.</p>
        
        <h3>Frontend Technologies:</h3>
        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Node.js</strong> - JavaScript runtime</li>
          <li><strong>Python (Django/Flask)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Databases</strong> - MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
          <li><strong>APIs</strong> - REST, GraphQL</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Salary Comparison (India 2026)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> ₹4-12 LPA</li>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> ₹5-15 LPA</li>
          <li><strong>Full Stack:</strong> ₹7-20 LPA</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Choose Frontend if you:</h2>
        <ul>

        <p>CSS Flexbox is one of the most powerful layout tools. Once you understand it, creating responsive layouts becomes super easy!</p>

        <h2>What is Flexbox?</h2>
        <p>Flexbox (Flexible Box) is a CSS layout method that makes it easy to arrange items in rows or columns and control their alignment.</p>

        <h2>Enable Flexbox</h2>
        <code>display: flex;</code>
        <p>Just add this to a container and all children become flex items!</p>

        <h2>Main Axis Direction</h2>
        <code>flex-direction: row;        /* left to right (default) */
flex-direction: column;     /* top to bottom */
flex-direction: row-reverse;
flex-direction: column-reverse;</code>

        <h2>Justify Content (Main Axis)</h2>
        <code>justify-content: flex-start;   /* left */
justify-content: flex-end;     /* right */
justify-content: center;       /* center */
justify-content: space-between;/* space between items */
justify-content: space-around; /* space around items */
justify-content: space-evenly; /* equal space everywhere */</code>

        <h2>Align Items (Cross Axis)</h2>
        <code>align-items: flex-start; /* top */
align-items: flex-end;   /* bottom */
align-items: center;     /* middle */
align-items: stretch;    /* stretch full height */</code>

        <h2>Flex Children Properties</h2>
        <code>flex-grow: 1;   /* how much to grow */
flex-shrink: 1; /* how much to shrink */
flex-basis: auto; /* initial size */
flex: 1;        /* shorthand (grow shrink basis) */
align-self: center; /* override parent align-items */</code>

        <h2>Wrap Items</h2>
        <code>flex-wrap: wrap;   /* items wrap to new line */
flex-wrap: nowrap; /* all in one line */</code>

        <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
        <h3>Center anything perfectly:</h3>
        <code>.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}</code>

        <h3>Navigation bar:</h3>
        <code>.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}</code>

        <h3>Card grid:</h3>
        <code>.cards {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
  justify-content: center;
}</code>

        <h2>Flexbox vs Grid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flexbox</strong>: 1D layout (row OR column)</li>
          <li><strong>Grid</strong>: 2D layout (rows AND columns)</li>
          <li>Use Flexbox for components, Grid for page layouts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Practice flexbox daily and in a week you'll be a pro! Flexbox Froggy game is great for practice. 🐸</p>

        <p>React Hooks changed everything! They let you use state and lifecycle in functional components. Let's master all the important hooks!</p>

        <h2>What are Hooks?</h2>
        <p>Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React features from function components. No more class components!</p>

        <h2>useState - Manage State</h2>
        <code>import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  return (
    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
      Count: {count}
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );
}</code>

        <h2>useEffect - Side Effects</h2>
        <code>import { useEffect } from 'react';

// Run once on mount
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

// Run when dependency changes
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = name;
}, [name]);

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer); // cleanup
}, []);</code>

        <h2>useContext - Global State</h2>
        <code>const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value="dark"&gt;
      &lt;Child /&gt;
    &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}

function Child() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return &lt;div&gt;Theme: {theme}&lt;/div&gt;;
}</code>

        <h2>useRef - DOM Access</h2>
        <code>const inputRef = useRef(null);

// Focus input on button click
&lt;input ref={inputRef} /&gt;
&lt;button onClick={() =&gt; inputRef.current.focus()}&gt;
  Focus
&lt;/button&gt;</code>

        <h2>useMemo - Performance</h2>
        <code>const expensive = useMemo(() => {
  return heavyCalculation(data);
}, [data]); // only recalculate when data changes</code>

        <h2>useCallback - Memoize Functions</h2>
        <code>const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(id);
}, [id]); // stable function reference</code>

        <h2>Custom Hooks</h2>
        <p>Extract logic into reusable hooks!</p>
        <code>function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(d => {
        setData(d);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}

// Use anywhere!
const { data, loading } = useFetch('/api/users');</code>

        <h2>Rules of Hooks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Only call hooks at TOP LEVEL (not inside conditions/loops)</li>
          <li>Only call hooks in REACT FUNCTIONS</li>
          <li>Custom hooks name must start with "use"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hooks are at the core of modern React. Master these and you'll write clean, powerful components! 🎣</p>

        <p>Git and GitHub are essential tools for every developer. Master version control and collaboration with this complete guide!</p>

        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system. It tracks changes in your code, lets you go back to previous versions, and collaborate with others.</p>

        <h2>Git vs GitHub</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Git</strong>: Tool installed on your computer</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub</strong>: Website to store and share Git repos online</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <code>git --version  # check if installed
# Download from git-scm.com</code>

        <h2>Git Configuration</h2>
        <code>git config --global user.name "Girish Giri"
git config --global user.email "girish@example.com"</code>

        <h2>Basic Commands</h2>
        <code>git init              # Start new repo
git status           # Check changes
git add .            # Stage all files
git add file.js      # Stage specific file
git commit -m "msg"  # Save snapshot
git log              # View history</code>

        <h2>Working with Remote (GitHub)</h2>
        <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git push -u origin main   # Push first time
git push                  # Push after
git pull                  # Get latest changes
git clone URL             # Copy repo to local</code>

        <h2>Branches</h2>
        <code>git branch              # List branches
git branch feature      # Create branch
git checkout feature    # Switch to branch
git checkout -b feature # Create + switch
git merge feature       # Merge into current
git branch -d feature   # Delete branch</code>

        <h2>Undoing Changes</h2>
        <code>git restore file.js     # Undo changes
git reset HEAD~1        # Undo last commit
git revert abc123       # Revert a commit safely</code>

        <h2>GitHub Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fork → Clone → Branch → Code → Push → Pull Request</li>
          <li>This is how real teams collaborate!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important GitHub Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Issues</strong>: Track bugs and features</li>
          <li><strong>Pull Requests</strong>: Code review before merge</li>
          <li><strong>Actions</strong>: Automate deployments</li>
          <li><strong>README.md</strong>: Document your project</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Commit often with meaningful messages</li>
          <li>Never commit directly to main</li>
          <li>Always pull before pushing</li>
          <li>Use .gitignore for node_modules, .env</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Git is a superpower for developers. Start using it today for every project and it'll become second nature! 💪</p>

        <p>70% of web traffic comes from mobile! If your website doesn't work on phones, you're losing users. Let's make your site look perfect on every device.</p>

        <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
        <p>Responsive design means your website automatically adapts to any screen size - mobile, tablet, desktop.</p>

        <h2>Mobile-First Approach</h2>
        <p>Design for mobile FIRST, then scale up for bigger screens. This is the industry standard!</p>
        <code>/* Mobile first */
.container { width: 100%; padding: 1rem; }

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container { padding: 2rem; }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container { max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; }
}</code>

        <h2>Viewport Meta Tag</h2>
        <p>Always add this to your HTML head:</p>
        <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>

        <h2>Flexible Images</h2>
        <code>img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}</code>

        <h2>CSS Media Queries</h2>
        <code>/* Common breakpoints */
@media (max-width: 480px) { /* Mobile */ }
@media (max-width: 768px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (max-width: 1024px) { /* Small desktop */ }
@media (min-width: 1200px) { /* Large desktop */ }</code>

        <h2>Responsive Flexbox</h2>
        <code>.cards {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
  flex: 1 1 300px; /* grow, shrink, min-width */
}</code>

        <h2>Responsive Grid</h2>
        <code>.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
}</code>

        <h2>Responsive Typography</h2>
        <code>/* Fluid font size */
html { font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 18px); }

h1 { font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 5vw, 3.5rem); }</code>

        <h2>Testing Responsiveness</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chrome DevTools → Toggle Device Toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)</li>
          <li>Test on real devices</li>
          <li>Test at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed widths in pixels</li>
          <li>Missing viewport meta tag</li>
          <li>Small touch targets on mobile</li>
          <li>Text too small to read</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Responsive design is not optional - it's required! Build mobile-first and your users will love your site. 📱</p>

        <p>A slow website loses visitors and money. 1 second delay = 7% less conversions! Let's make your site blazing fast.</p>

        <h2>Measure First</h2>
        <p>Use these tools to find issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> - Free, detailed report</li>
          <li><strong>Lighthouse</strong> - Chrome DevTools</li>
          <li><strong>GTmetrix</strong> - Detailed waterfall analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Image Optimization</h2>
        <p>Images are usually 60-70% of page weight!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>WebP format</strong> (30% smaller than JPEG)</li>
          <li>Compress images (TinyPNG, Squoosh)</li>
          <li>Use proper dimensions (don't load 3000px for 400px display)</li>
          <li>Use lazy loading</li>
        </ul>
        <code>&lt;img src="photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="description"&gt;</code>

        <h2>Code Splitting (React)</h2>
        <code>// Instead of importing everything
import HeavyComponent from './Heavy';

// Use lazy loading
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Heavy'));

&lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
  &lt;HeavyComponent /&gt;
&lt;/Suspense&gt;</code>

        <h2>Minimize CSS & JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove unused CSS (PurgeCSS)</li>
          <li>Minify files (Vite/Webpack does this in build)</li>
          <li>Remove console.log in production</li>
          <li>Tree shaking - remove unused code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Caching</h2>
        <code>// Service Worker caching
// Cache static assets for offline use
self.addEventListener('install', e => {
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open('v1').then(cache =>
      cache.addAll(['/index.html', '/styles.css'])
    )
  );
});</code>

        <h2>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</h2>
        <p>Host your site on Vercel/Netlify - they use CDN automatically! Your files served from server closest to user.</p>

        <h2>Fonts Optimization</h2>
        <code>/* Only load needed font weights */
@import url('...?family=Outfit:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');

/* Preconnect to font servers */
&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com"&gt;</code>

        <h2>Quick Wins Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Compress and WebP images</li>
          <li>✅ Enable lazy loading</li>
          <li>✅ Minify CSS/JS</li>
          <li>✅ Remove unused code</li>
          <li>✅ Use CDN</li>
          <li>✅ Enable GZIP compression</li>
          <li>✅ Optimize fonts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Target Scores</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good:</strong> 90+ on PageSpeed</li>
          <li><strong>LCP</strong> (Largest Content): under 2.5s</li>
          <li><strong>FID</strong> (Interaction): under 100ms</li>
          <li><strong>CLS</strong> (Layout Shift): under 0.1</li>

        <p>Are you using divs for everything? Stop! Semantic HTML makes your code meaningful, accessible, and better for SEO. Learn it now!</p>

        <h2>What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
        <p>Semantic elements have meaning. They tell the browser AND developers what kind of content is inside.</p>

        <h2>Non-Semantic vs Semantic</h2>
        <code>&lt;!-- Bad (non-semantic) --&gt;
&lt;div class="header"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="nav"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="main"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Good (semantic) --&gt;
&lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;main&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code>

        <h2>Page Structure Elements</h2>
        <code>&lt;header&gt; - Top of page/section
&lt;nav&gt;    - Navigation links
&lt;main&gt;   - Main content (only one per page!)
&lt;aside&gt;  - Sidebar content
&lt;footer&gt; - Bottom of page/section
&lt;section&gt; - Thematic grouping
&lt;article&gt; - Self-contained content (blog post, news)</code>

        <h2>Text Content Elements</h2>
        <code>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; - Headings (use only one h1!)
&lt;p&gt;          - Paragraphs
&lt;strong&gt;     - Important text (bold + meaning)
&lt;em&gt;         - Emphasized text (italic + meaning)
&lt;blockquote&gt; - Long quotes
&lt;code&gt;       - Code snippets
&lt;pre&gt;        - Preformatted text
&lt;time&gt;       - Dates and times</code>

        <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
        <code>&lt;button&gt; - Clickable actions
&lt;a&gt;      - Links to other pages
&lt;form&gt;   - User input forms
&lt;input&gt;  - Text input fields
&lt;select&gt; - Dropdown menus
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt; - Expandable content</code>

        <h2>Media Elements</h2>
        <code>&lt;img alt="description"&gt; - Images (ALWAYS add alt!)
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;   - Image with caption
&lt;video controls&gt;       - Video player
&lt;audio controls&gt;       - Audio player</code>

        <h2>Why Semantic HTML Matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SEO</strong>: Google understands your content better = higher rankings</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Screen readers work correctly</li>
          <li><strong>Readability</strong>: Code is easier to understand</li>
          <li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Easier to update and debug</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example: Blog Post Structure</h2>
        <code>&lt;article&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Blog Title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2026-02-02"&gt;Feb 2, 2026&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First paragraph...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
  
  &lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author: Girish Giri&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</code>

        <h2>Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Only ONE &lt;h1&gt; per page</li>
          <li>All images have meaningful alt text</li>
          <li>Use &lt;button&gt; for actions, &lt;a&gt; for navigation</li>
          <li>Use &lt;label&gt; for every form input</li>
          <li>Logical heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Start using semantic HTML in every project. Your SEO will thank you, your users will thank you, and future-you will thank you! 🏗️</p>

        <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It lets you run JavaScript on the server side — not just the browser. This means one language (JavaScript) can be used for both frontend and backend development!</p>

        <h2>Why Learn Node.js in 2026?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Most Popular Backend:</strong> Used by Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber</li>
          <li><strong>Fast & Scalable:</strong> Non-blocking I/O handles thousands of connections</li>
          <li><strong>NPM Ecosystem:</strong> 2 million+ packages available</li>
          <li><strong>Full Stack:</strong> JavaScript everywhere</li>
          <li><strong>High Salary:</strong> Node.js developers earn ₹8-25 LPA in India</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setting Up Node.js</h2>
        <code>
# Download from nodejs.org
node --version   # Check version
npm --version    # Check npm

# Create a project
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npm init -y
        </code>

        <h2>Your First Node.js Server</h2>
        <code>
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello World from Node.js!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
        </code>

        <h2>Express.js Framework</h2>
        <p>Express makes building APIs much easier:</p>
        <code>
npm install express

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

app.listen(3000);
        </code>

        <h2>Working with Files</h2>
        <code>
const fs = require('fs');

// Read file
fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Write file
fs.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello Node!', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File saved!');
});
        </code>

        <h2>REST API Example</h2>
        <code>
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'Girish' }]);
});

app.post('/api/users', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const newUser = req.body;
  res.status(201).json(newUser);
});
        </code>

        <h2>What is CSS Grid?</h2>
        <p>CSS Grid is a 2-dimensional layout system for the web. While Flexbox handles one dimension (row or column), Grid handles both simultaneously. It's the most powerful CSS layout tool available in 2026.</p>

        <h2>Basic Grid Setup</h2>
        <code>
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 20px;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Grid Template Areas</h2>
        <code>
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.main { grid-area: main; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
        </code>

        <h2>Responsive Grid Without Media Queries</h2>
        <code>
.cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Grid vs Flexbox</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use Grid:</strong> 2D layouts, complete page structure</li>
          <li><strong>Use Flexbox:</strong> 1D layouts, navigation bars, card content</li>
          <li><strong>Use Both:</strong> Grid for page layout, Flexbox inside grid items</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Placing Items</h2>
        <code>
.item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;  /* Span columns 1-2 */
  grid-row: 1 / 2;     /* Stay in row 1 */
}

/* Shorthand */
.item {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 3;
}
        </code>

        <p>CSS Grid will make your layouts 10x easier. Practice by building a newspaper-style layout! 🎯</p>

Understand types, interfaces, generics, and how TypeScript makes JavaScript development safer and easier.",content:`
        <h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
        <p>TypeScript is JavaScript with type annotations. It was created by Microsoft and has become one of the most loved programming languages. TypeScript catches errors at compile time, not runtime — saving you hours of debugging!</p>

        <h2>Why TypeScript in 2026?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Catch Bugs Early:</strong> Type errors caught before running</li>
          <li><strong>Better IDE Support:</strong> Autocomplete works perfectly</li>
          <li><strong>Industry Standard:</strong> Most companies use TypeScript</li>
          <li><strong>Scales Well:</strong> Essential for large codebases</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>TypeScript Basics</h2>
        <code>
// Variables with types
let name: string = "Girish";
let age: number = 14;
let isDeveloper: boolean = true;

// Arrays
let skills: string[] = ["React", "Node.js", "CSS"];
let nums: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Functions
function greet(name: string): string {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <code>
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;  // Optional property
}

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Girish Giri",
  email: "dev@example.com"
};
        </code>

        <h2>Generics</h2>
        <code>
function getFirst<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[0];
}

const firstNum = getFirst([1, 2, 3]);     // number
const firstStr = getFirst(["a", "b"]);   // string
        </code>

        <h2>TypeScript with React</h2>
        <code>
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

const Button: React.FC&lt;ButtonProps&gt; = ({ label, onClick, disabled }) => {
  return &lt;button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}&gt;{label}&lt;/button&gt;;
};
        </code>

Build SEO-friendly React apps with server-side rendering, static generation, and the App Router.",content:`
        <h2>What is Next.js?</h2>
        <p>Next.js is the most popular React framework in 2026. It adds features React doesn't have out of the box: server-side rendering, static site generation, file-based routing, API routes, and more. Built by Vercel, it's used by companies like TikTok, Twitch, and Hulu.</p>

        <h2>Next.js vs React</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>React:</strong> Client-side rendering (CSR), need to configure routing</li>
          <li><strong>Next.js:</strong> SSR + SSG + CSR, automatic routing, SEO-friendly</li>
          <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Next.js wins — search engines can read server-rendered HTML</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Next.js is faster out of the box</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating a Next.js App</h2>
        <code>
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
        </code>

        <h2>App Router (Next.js 13+)</h2>
        <code>
// app/page.js - Home page
export default function HomePage() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Next.js!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

// app/about/page.js - /about route
export default function AboutPage() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;About Us&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

// app/blog/[slug]/page.js - Dynamic route
export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Post: {params.slug}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Server Components vs Client Components</h2>
        <code>
// Server Component (default) - runs on server
async function BlogList() {
  const posts = await fetch('/api/posts').then(r => r.json());
  return &lt;ul&gt;{posts.map(p => &lt;li&gt;{p.title}&lt;/li&gt;)}&lt;/ul&gt;;
}

// Client Component - add "use client"
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return &lt;button onClick={() => setCount(c => c+1)}&gt;{count}&lt;/button&gt;;
}
        </code>

        <h2>API Routes</h2>
        <code>
// app/api/hello/route.js
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ message: "Hello from Next.js API!" });
}
        </code>

        <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
        <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as flexible JSON-like documents instead of rigid tables. It's the most popular database for modern web development and part of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).</p>

        <h2>MongoDB vs SQL</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Tables, rows, strict schema, relations</li>
          <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> Collections, documents, flexible schema, embedded data</li>
          <li><strong>When to use MongoDB:</strong> Flexible data, rapid development, scaling</li>

Learn utility classes, responsive design, dark mode, and how to build beautiful UIs faster than ever.",content:`
        <h2>What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
        <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply pre-built utility classes directly in your HTML. It's the most popular CSS framework in 2026, used by millions of developers.</p>

        <h2>Tailwind vs Bootstrap vs Custom CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> Pre-built components, less customization</li>
          <li><strong>Tailwind:</strong> Utility classes, unlimited customization, smaller bundle</li>
          <li><strong>Custom CSS:</strong> Full control, more time to write</li>
          <li><strong>Winner 2026:</strong> Tailwind CSS for most projects</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <code>
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

# Add to CSS
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
        </code>

        <h2>Common Utility Classes</h2>
        <code>
&lt;!-- Button --&gt;
&lt;button class="bg-orange-500 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-full hover:bg-orange-600 transition"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;!-- Card --&gt;
&lt;div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 max-w-sm"&gt;
  &lt;h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800"&gt;Card Title&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p class="text-gray-500 mt-2"&gt;Card description here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>

        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <code>
&lt;!-- Mobile: 1 col, Tablet: 2 cols, Desktop: 3 cols --&gt;
&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Item 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Item 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Item 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>

        <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
        <code>
&lt;div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-black dark:text-white"&gt;
  Looks good in both modes!
&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>

        <p>Tailwind speeds up UI development by 3x. Once you learn it, you'll never go back to writing custom CSS! 🎨</p>

Covers closures, promises, event loop, and more.",content:`
        <h2>Most Important JS Interview Topics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Closures</strong> – Always asked</li>
          <li><strong>Event Loop</strong> – Must know</li>
          <li><strong>Promises & Async/Await</strong> – Essential</li>
          <li><strong>this keyword</strong> – Tricky but important</li>
          <li><strong>Prototypes</strong> – Deep concept</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Q1: What is a Closure?</h2>
        <code>
function outer() {
  let count = 0;  // Persists because of closure
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
        </code>

        <h2>Q2: Explain the Event Loop</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is single-threaded. The Event Loop handles async operations: Call Stack → WebAPIs → Callback Queue → Call Stack. This is why setTimeout with 0ms doesn't run immediately.</p>

        <h2>Q3: var vs let vs const</h2>
        <code>
var x = 1;   // Function-scoped, hoisted, re-declarable
let y = 2;   // Block-scoped, not hoisted
const z = 3; // Block-scoped, constant (object properties can change)
        </code>

        <h2>Q4: Promise vs Async/Await</h2>
        <code>
// Promises
fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Async/Await (cleaner)
async function getData() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Q5: Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy</h2>
        <code>
// Shallow copy (nested objects still reference)
const shallow = { ...original };

// Deep copy
const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
// Or use structuredClone (modern)
const deep2 = structuredClone(original);
        </code>

        <h2>Q6: What is Hoisting?</h2>
        <p>Variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution. var is hoisted and initialized as undefined. let/const are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone).</p>

        <p>Practice these daily and you'll ace any JS interview! 💪</p>

        <h2>Why Build Projects?</h2>
        <p>Reading tutorials won't make you a React developer. Building projects will. Here are 25 ideas — from simple to complex — to level up your React skills in 2026.</p>

        <h2>Beginner Projects (1-7 days each)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Todo App:</strong> useState, event handlers, CRUD</li>
          <li><strong>Weather App:</strong> API calls, useEffect, conditional rendering</li>
          <li><strong>Calculator:</strong> Component state, math logic</li>
          <li><strong>Quote Generator:</strong> Random data display, fetch API</li>
          <li><strong>Color Picker:</strong> useState, CSS dynamic styles</li>
          <li><strong>Countdown Timer:</strong> useEffect, setInterval, cleanup</li>
          <li><strong>BMI Calculator:</strong> Forms, calculations, display results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intermediate Projects (1-2 weeks each)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GitHub Profile Viewer:</strong> GitHub API, user search</li>
          <li><strong>Movie App:</strong> TMDB API, search, filters, details page</li>
          <li><strong>E-commerce Cart:</strong> Context API, cart management</li>
          <li><strong>Blog Platform:</strong> CRUD, routing, markdown</li>
          <li><strong>Chat App UI:</strong> WebSocket simulation, real-time feel</li>
          <li><strong>Expense Tracker:</strong> Charts, localStorage, categories</li>
          <li><strong>Recipe App:</strong> API integration, favorites, filters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Projects (2-4 weeks each)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full Stack Social Media:</strong> Node.js backend, auth, posts</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time Chat:</strong> Socket.io, rooms, notifications</li>
          <li><strong>Job Board:</strong> Job listings, applications, admin panel</li>
          <li><strong>Kanban Board:</strong> Drag and drop, multiple boards</li>
          <li><strong>Video Streaming UI:</strong> YouTube-like interface</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio Builder:</strong> Drag-drop, templates, export</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Recommendation</h2>
        <p>Start with the Todo App, then build the Movie App (it teaches everything you need). After that, build a Full Stack app. These three projects will make you job-ready!</p>

        <p>I built my portfolio website as my main project. It's now on GitHub Pages and has real visitors! 🎯</p>

Avoid common mistakes, find the best resources, and code every single day.",content:`
        <h2>The Truth About Learning Coding</h2>
        <p>Most people take 6-12 months to become job-ready. But with the right strategy, you can cut this time in half. I started coding at age 13 and built a working portfolio website within months. Here's how.</p>

        <h2>The #1 Mistake Beginners Make</h2>
        <p>"Tutorial hell" — watching tutorials without building anything. You can watch 100 hours of React tutorials and still not know how to build a single component. Build after every 20 minutes of learning.</p>

        <h2>The 70-20-10 Rule</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>70%:</strong> Building actual projects</li>
          <li><strong>20%:</strong> Reading docs and articles</li>
          <li><strong>10%:</strong> Watching tutorials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Perfect Learning Path (6 months)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> HTML + CSS — Build 5 static websites</li>
          <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> JavaScript basics — Build 3 games</li>
          <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> JavaScript advanced — DOM, APIs, events</li>
          <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> React — Build 3 React apps</li>
          <li><strong>Month 5:</strong> Node.js + Express — Build a REST API</li>
          <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> Full stack project + Portfolio</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Free Resources</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Odin Project:</strong> Best free full-stack curriculum</li>
          <li><strong>freeCodeCamp:</strong> Structured, free, with certificates</li>
          <li><strong>MDN Web Docs:</strong> Best reference for HTML/CSS/JS</li>
          <li><strong>React Docs:</strong> Official React tutorial is excellent</li>
          <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Traversy Media, Fireship, Kevin Powell</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Daily Habits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Code every day — even 30 minutes</li>
          <li>Use GitHub daily to track progress</li>
          <li>Build one project every 2 weeks</li>
          <li>Read one article every day</li>
          <li>Join Discord communities for developers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I code every day without fail. Even on school days, I spend at least 1 hour coding. Consistency beats intensity! 📅</p>

        <h2>Top Web Design Trends 2026</h2>

        <h2>1. Glassmorphism is Still Going Strong</h2>
        <p>Frosted glass effects with backdrop-filter: blur() are everywhere. Cards and modals with semi-transparent backgrounds look premium and modern.</p>
        <code>
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 16px;
}
        </code>

        <h2>2. Dark Mode as Default</h2>
        <p>Over 82% of users prefer dark mode. Design dark-first, then add light mode. Darker themes also save battery life on OLED screens.</p>

        <h2>3. Micro-Animations Everywhere</h2>
        <p>Subtle hover effects, scroll animations, loading states, and transition animations make websites feel alive. CSS animations and Framer Motion are popular tools.</p>

        <h2>4. Bento Grid Layouts</h2>
        <p>Inspired by Apple's marketing pages, bento grid layouts use CSS Grid to create magazine-style layouts with varying card sizes.</p>

        <h2>5. Bold Typography</h2>
        <p>Huge, bold headings with thin body text. Variable fonts that change weight on scroll. Typography is becoming a design element itself.</p>

        <h2>6. Scroll-Triggered Animations</h2>
        <p>Elements animating as you scroll. The CSS Scroll Animation API is now widely supported, making this possible without JavaScript libraries.</p>

        <h2>7. AI-Assisted Design</h2>
        <p>Figma AI, Adobe Firefly, and other tools are helping designers create faster. In 2026, knowing how to prompt AI design tools is a valuable skill.</p>

        <h2>What's Dying in 2026?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Heavy parallax effects (bad for performance)</li>
          <li>Carousels/sliders (low engagement)</li>
          <li>Centered hero text with stock photo background</li>
          <li>Hamburger menus on desktop</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stay current with design trends, but always prioritize usability over aesthetics! 🎨</p>

        <h2>CSS Transitions vs Animations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transitions:</strong> Simple from A to B (hover effects)</li>
          <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Complex multi-step animations with @keyframes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
        <code>
.button {
  background: #ff3700;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.button:hover {
  background: #222331;
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}
        </code>

        <h2>CSS Keyframes Animations</h2>
        <code>
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out forwards;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Animation Properties</h2>
        <code>
.element {
  animation-name: fadeInUp;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-delay: 0.2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* or a number */
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;

  /* Shorthand */
  animation: fadeInUp 1s ease-in-out 0.2s forwards;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Loading Spinner</h2>
        <code>
@keyframes spin {
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

.spinner {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 4px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.3);
  border-top-color: #ff3700;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.8s linear infinite;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Bouncing Ball</h2>
        <code>
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); animation-timing-function: ease-in; }
  50% { transform: translateY(-60px); animation-timing-function: ease-out; }
}

.ball {
  animation: bounce 1s infinite;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Performance Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Only animate transform and opacity (GPU-accelerated)</li>
          <li>Use will-change: transform for complex animations</li>
          <li>Avoid animating width, height, margin (causes reflow)</li>
          <li>Use prefers-reduced-motion media query for accessibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CSS animations can replace most JavaScript animation libraries — faster and simpler! ✨</p>

Each project teaches real skills you'll use in your career.",content:`
        <h2>Why Build Projects?</h2>
        <p>The best way to learn JavaScript is to build projects. Here are 10 projects that will teach you everything — DOM manipulation, events, APIs, localStorage, and more.</p>

        <h2>Project 1: Digital Clock</h2>
        <code>
function updateClock() {
  const now = new Date();
  const time = now.toLocaleTimeString();

A Simple Explanation for Beginners 2026",category:"JavaScript",date:"February 3, 2026",readTime:"6 min read",image:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop",excerpt:"Understand what APIs are with simple real-world analogies. Learn REST APIs, HTTP methods, JSON, and how to use APIs in your projects.",content:`
        <h2>What is an API?</h2>
        <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. Think of it like a waiter at a restaurant: you (the app) tell the waiter (the API) what you want. The waiter goes to the kitchen (the server) and comes back with your food (data).</p>

        <h2>Real-World API Examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weather App:</strong> Your app asks OpenWeather API for weather data</li>
          <li><strong>Google Maps:</strong> Your website uses Google Maps API to show maps</li>
          <li><strong>Login with Google:</strong> Uses Google's Auth API</li>
          <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Stripe API handles payments for your store</li>
          <li><strong>WhatsApp:</strong> WhatsApp Business API sends automated messages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>REST API Basics</h2>
        <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most common API style. It uses HTTP methods:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GET:</strong> Fetch data (like reading)</li>
          <li><strong>POST:</strong> Create data (like submitting a form)</li>
          <li><strong>PUT/PATCH:</strong> Update data</li>
          <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Delete data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using an API in JavaScript</h2>
        <code>
// GET request - fetch users
async function getUsers() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users);
}

// POST request - create a user
async function createUser() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Girish', email: 'dev@test.com' })
  });
  const newUser = await response.json();
  console.log(newUser);
}
        </code>

        <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>200:</strong> OK — Request successful</li>
          <li><strong>201:</strong> Created — New resource created</li>
          <li><strong>400:</strong> Bad Request — Client sent wrong data</li>
          <li><strong>401:</strong> Unauthorized — Need to login</li>
          <li><strong>404:</strong> Not Found — Resource doesn't exist</li>
          <li><strong>500:</strong> Server Error — Something broke on server</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Free APIs to Practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JSONPlaceholder — fake REST API for testing</li>
          <li>OpenWeather — weather data</li>
          <li>GitHub API — repositories and user data</li>
          <li>CoinGecko — cryptocurrency prices</li>
          <li>NASA API — space data and images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>APIs are everywhere. Once you understand them, you can build apps that connect to any service! 🌐</p>

Write code that's readable, maintainable, and bug-free.",content:`
        <h2>What is Clean Code?</h2>
        <p>Clean code is code that any developer can read and understand without explanation. The famous programmer Robert C. Martin says: "Clean code reads like well-written prose." Your code isn't just for machines — it's for humans.</p>

        <h2>1. Use Meaningful Names</h2>
        <code>
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const x = users.filter(u => u.a > 18);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const adultUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 18);
        </code>

        <h2>2. Functions Should Do One Thing</h2>
        <code>
// Bad - does too many things
function processUser(user) {
  validateEmail(user.email);
  hashPassword(user.password);
  saveToDatabase(user);
  sendWelcomeEmail(user);
}

// Good - separate concerns
function registerUser(user) {
  const validUser = validateUser(user);
  const hashedUser = hashUserPassword(validUser);
  const savedUser = saveUser(hashedUser);
  sendWelcomeEmail(savedUser);
  return savedUser;
}
        </code>

        <h2>3. Keep Functions Small</h2>
        <p>Functions should be 5-20 lines ideally. If your function is longer than that, it's probably doing too much. Break it into smaller functions.</p>

        <h2>4. Avoid Magic Numbers</h2>
        <code>
// Bad
if (age > 18) { ... }
setTimeout(doSomething, 86400000);

// Good
const MINIMUM_AGE = 18;
const ONE_DAY_IN_MS = 86400 * 1000;

if (age > MINIMUM_AGE) { ... }
setTimeout(doSomething, ONE_DAY_IN_MS);
        </code>

        <h2>5. DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>
        <code>
// Bad - repeated logic
function calculateDiscountForStudent(price) {
  return price * 0.8;
}
function calculateDiscountForSenior(price) {
  return price * 0.8;
}

// Good
function calculateDiscount(price, discountRate = 0.8) {
  return price * discountRate;
}
        </code>

        <h2>6. Comment "Why", Not "What"</h2>
        <code>
// Bad comment
let count = 0; // set count to 0

// Good comment
// Using count to track retry attempts — max 3 retries per API spec
let retryCount = 0;
        </code>

        <h2>7. Handle Errors Properly</h2>
        <code>
// Bad
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch(url);
  return data.json();
}

// Good
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(\`HTTP error: \${response.status}\`);
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
        </code>

        <p>Clean code is a habit. Start applying these rules today and your code will become 10x better! 🧹</p>

Understand how to read designs, extract CSS values, and collaborate with designers effectively.",content:`
        <h2>Why Should Developers Learn Figma?</h2>
        <p>Figma is the world's most popular design tool. As a developer, you don't need to be a designer, but understanding Figma will make you 3x more efficient when implementing designs. You'll also be able to create your own mockups when working alone.</p>

        <h2>Figma Basics for Developers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frames:</strong> Like div containers — define layout boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>Components:</strong> Like React components — reusable design elements</li>
          <li><strong>Auto Layout:</strong> Like Flexbox — automatic spacing and alignment</li>
          <li><strong>Variants:</strong> Like component props — different states</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Extracting CSS from Figma</h2>
        <p>Click any element → Right panel shows all CSS values:</p>
        <code>
/* Figma shows you exactly this CSS */
.button {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 200px;
  height: 48px;
  background: #FF3700;
  border-radius: 24px;
  
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #FFFFFF;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Figma for Responsive Design</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create frames at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1440px (desktop)</li>
          <li>Use Auto Layout for elements that should stretch</li>
          <li>Check component how it looks at different sizes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dev Mode in Figma</h2>
        <p>Figma's Dev Mode (paid feature) shows exact measurements, spacing, colors, and exportable assets. In the free version, you can inspect by clicking elements and looking at the right panel.</p>

        <h2>Figma Plugins for Developers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Figma to Code:</strong> Export HTML/CSS/React code</li>
          <li><strong>Tokens Studio:</strong> Design tokens for code</li>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Check accessibility color contrast</li>
          <li><strong>Unsplash:</strong> Free stock photos directly in Figma</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Workflow</h2>
        <p>I design in Figma first (mobile, then desktop), then code it. This saves me from making layout decisions while coding — I just focus on implementing what I designed.</p>

        <p>Even basic Figma skills make you a much better developer. Start with the free tier! 🎨</p>

Skip Redux for smaller apps and use Context to share state across your component tree.",content:`
        <h2>What is Context API?</h2>
        <p>Context lets you pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. It solves "prop drilling" — when you have to pass data through many components just to reach the one that needs it.</p>

        <h2>Prop Drilling Problem</h2>
        <code>
// Without Context - prop drilling nightmare
&lt;App user={user}&gt;
  &lt;Layout user={user}&gt;
    &lt;Sidebar user={user}&gt;
      &lt;UserProfile user={user} /&gt;
    &lt;/Sidebar&gt;
  &lt;/Layout&gt;
&lt;/App&gt;
        </code>

        <h2>Creating a Context</h2>
        <code>
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

// 1. Create context
const UserContext = createContext(null);

// 2. Create Provider
export function UserProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  return (
    &lt;UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/UserContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}

// 3. Custom hook for easy use
export function useUser() {
  const context = useContext(UserContext);
  if (!context) throw new Error('useUser must be inside UserProvider');
  return context;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Using Context in Components</h2>
        <code>
// Wrap your app
function App() {
  return (
    &lt;UserProvider&gt;
      &lt;Layout /&gt;  // No need to pass user as prop!
    &lt;/UserProvider&gt;
  );
}

// Use anywhere in the tree
function UserProfile() {
  const { user, setUser } = useUser();
  return &lt;div&gt;{user?.name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Shopping Cart Example</h2>
        <code>
const CartContext = createContext(null);

export function CartProvider({ children }) {
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);

  const addToCart = (item) => setCartItems(prev => [...prev, item]);
  const removeFromCart = (id) => setCartItems(prev => prev.filter(i => i.id !== id));
  const totalItems = cartItems.length;

  return (
    &lt;CartContext.Provider value={{ cartItems, addToCart, removeFromCart, totalItems }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/CartContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}
        </code>

        <h2>Context vs Redux</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> Simple, built-in, perfect for small-medium apps</li>
          <li><strong>Redux:</strong> Complex, powerful, great for large apps with complex state</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use Context first, add Redux only when needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Context API is one of the most underrated React features. Master it before learning Redux! 🎯</p>

Learn theming, dark mode, and dynamic styles.",content:`
        <h2>What are CSS Variables?</h2>
        <p>CSS Variables (officially called Custom Properties) let you store values and reuse them throughout your CSS. Instead of repeating #ff3700 20 times, you define it once and reference it everywhere.</p>

        <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
        <code>
/* Define variables on :root (global) */
:root {
  --primary-color: #ff3700;
  --secondary-color: #222331;
  --bg-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #333333;
  --border-radius: 12px;
  --spacing-sm: 8px;
  --spacing-md: 16px;
  --spacing-lg: 32px;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
  --shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

/* Use with var() */
.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  padding: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-md);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow);
}
        </code>

        <h2>Dark Mode with CSS Variables</h2>
        <code>
:root {
  --bg: #ffffff;
  --text: #222222;
  --card-bg: #f5f5f5;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg: #1a1a2e;
  --text: #ffffff;
  --card-bg: #16213e;
}

body {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
}

/* Toggle with JavaScript */
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
        </code>

        <h2>CSS Variables vs Sass Variables</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CSS Variables:</strong> Runtime, can be changed with JS, cascade</li>
          <li><strong>Sass Variables:</strong> Compile-time, no JS access, no cascade</li>
          <li><strong>Use CSS Variables</strong> for theming, dynamic values</li>
          <li><strong>Use Sass Variables</strong> for constants that never change</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dynamic Variables with JavaScript</h2>
        <code>
// Read CSS variable
const root = document.documentElement;
const primaryColor = getComputedStyle(root).getPropertyValue('--primary-color');

// Update CSS variable
root.style.setProperty('--primary-color', '#00ff88');

// This instantly updates ALL elements using --primary-color!
        </code>

        <h2>Component-Level Variables</h2>
        <code>
.card {
  --card-padding: 20px;
  --card-radius: 12px;
  
  padding: var(--card-padding);
  border-radius: var(--card-radius);
}

/* Override for specific instance */
.card.large {
  --card-padding: 40px;
}
        </code>

        <p>CSS Variables make your stylesheets 10x more maintainable. I use them in all my projects including this portfolio! 🎨</p>

# Add A records pointing to GitHub IPs:
# 185.199.108.153
# 185.199.109.153
# 185.199.110.153
# 185.199.111.153
        </code>

        <h2>SSL Certificate (HTTPS)</h2>
        <p>All modern hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) give you FREE SSL automatically. HTTPS is required for Google AdSense approval and good SEO rankings.</p>

        <h2>Paid Hosting Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hostinger:</strong> ₹69/month — best value for PHP sites</li>
          <li><strong>DigitalOcean:</strong> $6/month — for Node.js backends</li>
          <li><strong>AWS:</strong> Pay as you use — enterprise apps</li>
          <li><strong>Cloudflare Pages:</strong> Free + better performance than Vercel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Stack</h2>
        <p>My portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom setup. For client projects, I use Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend). Zero monthly cost for small apps!</p>

        <p>Start with free hosting, upgrade when you need it. Professional domain costs only ₹700-900/year. Get one! 🌐</p>

        <h2>Why ES6+ Matters</h2>
        <p>ES6 (2015) transformed JavaScript completely. If you're still writing old-style JS, you're writing outdated code. Modern React development requires fluency in all these features.</p>

        <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
        <code>
// Old way
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const greet = name => \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
const getObj = () => ({ key: 'value' }); // Return object
        </code>

        <h2>Destructuring</h2>
        <code>
// Array destructuring
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Object destructuring
const { name, age, email = 'default@mail.com' } = user;

// In function params
function display({ name, age }) {
  console.log(\`\${name} is \${age}\`);
}

// Rename while destructuring
const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
        </code>

        <h2>Spread and Rest Operators</h2>
        <code>
// Spread - expand arrays/objects
const merged = [...arr1, ...arr2];
const updatedUser = { ...user, age: 25 };

// Rest - collect remaining
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
        </code>

        <h2>Template Literals</h2>
        <code>
const name = "Girish";
const age = 14;

// Old
const msg = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + age;

// Template literals
const msg = \`My name is \${name} and I am \${age}\`;

// Multi-line
const html = \`
  &lt;div class="card"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;\${name}&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age: \${age}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
\`;
        </code>

        <h2>Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing</h2>
        <code>
// Optional chaining - no more "cannot read property of undefined"
const city = user?.address?.city;
const firstItem = cart?.items?.[0]?.name;

// Nullish coalescing - use default only for null/undefined
const name = user.name ?? "Anonymous";
const count = items.count ?? 0;
        </code>

        <h2>Array Methods (ES6+)</h2>
        <code>
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// filter, map, reduce
const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);   // [2,4,6]
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);           // [2,4,6,8,10,12]
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0); // 21

// find, every, some
const found = numbers.find(n => n > 3);     // 4
const allPos = numbers.every(n => n > 0);   // true
const hasEven = numbers.some(n => n % 2 === 0); // true
        </code>

        <h2>ES Modules</h2>
        <code>
// Export
export const PI = 3.14;
export function calculate() { ... }
export default class App { ... }

// Import
import App from './App';
import { PI, calculate } from './utils';
import * as Utils from './utils';
        </code>

        <p>These features are used in every line of modern React code. Master them and React becomes much easier! 🚀</p>

Learn routing, navigation, dynamic routes, protected routes, and the new Data Router API.",content:`
        <h2>What is React Router?</h2>
        <p>React Router is the standard routing library for React. It enables navigation between different components/pages without full page reloads — making React apps feel like native apps. Version 6 brought major improvements.</p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <code>
npm install react-router-dom
        </code>

        <h2>Basic Setup</h2>
        <code>
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
      &lt;Routes&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/" element={&lt;Home /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/about" element={&lt;About /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/blog" element={&lt;Blog /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/blog/:slug" element={&lt;BlogPost /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="*" element={&lt;NotFound /&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;/Routes&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
  );
}
        </code>

        <h2>Navigation with useNavigate and Link</h2>
        <code>
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

// Link component (use instead of &lt;a&gt;)
&lt;Link to="/about"&gt;About Us&lt;/Link&gt;
&lt;Link to="/blog/react-tutorial" state={{ from: 'home' }}&gt;Read Blog&lt;/Link&gt;

// Programmatic navigation
function LoginPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  function handleLogin() {
    // After successful login
    navigate('/dashboard');
    // Go back
    navigate(-1);
    // Replace (no back button)
    navigate('/home', { replace: true });
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Dynamic Routes and useParams</h2>
        <code>
// Route definition
&lt;Route path="/blog/:slug" element={&lt;BlogPost /&gt;} /&gt;

// In BlogPost component
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function BlogPost() {
  const { slug } = useParams();
  // slug = "react-tutorial" when URL is /blog/react-tutorial
  return &lt;div&gt;Post: {slug}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
        </code>

        <h2>Nested Routes</h2>
        <code>
&lt;Route path="/dashboard" element={&lt;Dashboard /&gt;}&gt;
  &lt;Route index element={&lt;DashboardHome /&gt;} /&gt;
  &lt;Route path="profile" element={&lt;Profile /&gt;} /&gt;
  &lt;Route path="settings" element={&lt;Settings /&gt;} /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;

// Dashboard component needs &lt;Outlet /&gt;
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Sidebar /&gt;
      &lt;Outlet /&gt; {/* Child routes render here */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
        </code>

        <h2>Protected Routes</h2>
        <code>
function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  if (!user) return &lt;Navigate to="/login" replace /&gt;;
  return children;
}

&lt;Route path="/dashboard" element={
  &lt;ProtectedRoute&gt;
    &lt;Dashboard /&gt;
  &lt;/ProtectedRoute&gt;
} /&gt;
        </code>

        <h2>My Portfolio Uses HashRouter</h2>
        <p>Since my portfolio is on GitHub Pages, I use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter. This handles routing without server configuration — perfect for static hosting!</p>

        <p>React Router is essential for any React app beyond a single page. Master it! 🗺️</p>

        <p>Media queries allow CSS to apply different styles based on device characteristics — screen width, orientation, resolution. They are the foundation of responsive web design.</p>

        <h2>Media Query Syntax</h2>
        <code>
/* Apply when screen is max 768px */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 0 15px;
  }
}

/* Apply when screen is min 768px */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

/* Range */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .sidebar {
    display: none;
  }
}

/* Orientation */
@media (orientation: landscape) {
  .hero {
    height: 60vh;
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Standard Breakpoints 2026</h2>
        <code>
/* Mobile First (recommended) */
/* Base CSS (mobile) */
.container { padding: 0 15px; }

/* Tablet (>= 640px) */
@media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

/* Small Desktop (>= 768px) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Medium Desktop (>= 1024px) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

/* Large Desktop (>= 1280px) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }

/* XL Desktop (>= 1536px) */
@media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }
        </code>

        <h2>Mobile First Approach</h2>
        <p>Always design and code for mobile first, then add styles for larger screens. This results in faster mobile performance and cleaner CSS.</p>
        <code>
/* Mobile first example */
.nav {
  flex-direction: column; /* Mobile: vertical */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .nav {
    flex-direction: row; /* Desktop: horizontal */
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Responsive Typography</h2>
        <code>
/* Clamp() - responsive font without media queries! */
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 3rem);
  /* Min: 1.5rem, Preferred: 4vw, Max: 3rem */
}

p {
  font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2vw, 1.1rem);
}
        </code>

        <h2>Container Queries (Modern)</h2>
        <code>
/* Styles based on parent container size, not viewport! */
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
        </code>

        <h2>Dark Mode Media Query</h2>
        <code>
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg: #1a1a2e;
    --text: #ffffff;
  }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
        </code>

        <p>Responsive design is not optional in 2026 — over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Make every website fully responsive! 📱</p>
